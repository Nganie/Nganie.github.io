Wow. This is difficult. I am trying to juggle being a full-time mom and getting in as much time to code when my son is asleep. The difficult part is understanding the prompt and figuring out the methods/arguments when I don't really know how to use what I've been taught. I am unsure of its limitations. It hasn't all come together but I hope that it will eventually... It gets frustrating because as much as I want to move through each lab sometimes i'll just get stuck. I'm a visual learner so I honestly don't know what to do. I don't feel like I'm as equipped to solve certain labs. For instance, I am stuck on the "Valid Tic Tac Toe Move." I don't know how to combine my helper position_move? into the valid_move? method i'll be defining. It's frustrating especially because I'm tired but I don't want to give up on it since I don't know how long I have until my son wakes up to be nursed back to bed. Woe is me!
