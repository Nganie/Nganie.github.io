Coding has gotten harder or maybe I am just not grasping it. There is still so much to understand but the fact that there is not just one way to write code is messing with me. Sometimes I just dont know how to solve  a problem and I reach a dead end. I have to literally step away from the computer and go back to the problem and solve it. It gets frustrating because it is programmed in us to want to pass. Failing makes you feel so vulnerable so failing a lot has been a hit to the ego. At times I lose confidence in myself and question whether I can get through this. But then another part of me is constantly reminding me of the end goal and it is the reason why I started this journey in the first place. Not to get too sentimental but my son is the reason why I haven't thrown my computer out the window and given up. I am hoping that these little failures will get me to the right places and i'll eventually start passing more consistently without having to bang my head on my desk. Hopefully, it will all just 'click' when I'm given a problem because I wish to reach that level of confidence in this skill i'm obtaining. I have to learn to accept the failures for what they are.. lessons and move forward.
