Once I gave birth to my son, I was transformed and reborn as a mother. That title holds a completely new meaning that i'm fortunate to experience because now when I look at mother(s), I witness the miracles she performs, and can fully appreciate them. In the beginning, I had trouble figuring out what kind of mother I would be and what I wanted to do. As my son gets older, I know that I want to be present so being a work-from-home mother is ideal. Is it possible to be in a field that caters the life you want? I hope so. I am a Jack-of-all-trades: I make jewelery, I sing and create music, I enjoy storyboarding video concepts for music, and building websites. But, I felt I was lacking something that could help me be greater. I wanted to learn to code because I think it will help me to fuse all of my passions together and find a career that fitsmy  lifestyle as a multi-faceted mother.
