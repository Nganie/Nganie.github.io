What does that mean for us students currently learning? I am already a concerned consumer that is quite dependent on the net for its easy access to information and free sources, but as someone who wants to create on the many platforms that are heavy reliant on the net...I wonder what our future is going to look like. These restrictions and limitations reminds me of the forewarnings in George Orwell's "1982" and Ayn Rand's "Anthem."
