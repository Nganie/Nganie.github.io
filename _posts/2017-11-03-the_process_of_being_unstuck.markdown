I am back and ready to accomplish this bootcamp. As a first time mother, it has been difficult juggling everything but my mind and heart are finally aligned. I was a little self conscious before and worried that maybe I just wasn't going to get this thing but because I am a stubborn bull- I am perisistent at solving these labs (it literally drives me crazy). I had to go look at my past posts and get over whatever it was I was going through and focus on my end goal. I really do want this but I need to work harder. So here we go..
